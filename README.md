# head-circumference-20
A neural network was trained to measure fetal [head-circumference](https://github.com/DavidMagezi/head-circumference) on ultrasound images, using python (pytorch) on a PC. This will now be deployed using modern C++. In contrast to the [C++ 17 version](https://github.com/DavidMagezi/head-cirumference-embedded), this version uses C++20 standard and makes use of modules.
